# ORF523 Convex and Conic Optimization Coursework

This repository contains my personal coursework solutions for the Spring 2021 graduate-level course ORF523 - Convex and Conic Optimization offered by Princeton University.

## Content

- `hw_pdfs`: This directory contains the problem sets provided during the course.
- `media`: This directory contains relevant media used for solving the problems, such as images.
- `wrk_space`: This is my workspace where I put together the solutions for the problem sets. It contains Jupyter notebooks with Python code solving the problems, along with other associated files.

Please note that this repository is intended as a personal archive and for learning purposes. I strongly discourage using these solutions to circumvent learning in an academic setting.

## Course References
The course utilized several prestigious textbooks, including:
1. A. Ben-Tal and A. Nemirovski, Lecture Notes on Modern Convex Optimization
2. S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe, Convex Optimization
3. M. Laurent and F. Vallentin, Semidefinite Optimization
4. R. Vanderbei, Linear Programming and Extentions
